### **Introduction to Networks**

- **Definition**: A network is a collection of connected devices (e.g., computers, servers, routers) that share resources and communicate with each other.
- **Purpose**: Enable data sharing, communication, and resource management.
- **Key Components**:
    - **Devices**: Computers, servers, printers, etc.
    - **Media**: Wired (Ethernet cables) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
    - **Protocols**: Rules for communication (e.g., TCP/IP).

### **Types of Networks**

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**:
    - Covers a small area, such as an office or home.
    - High speed and low latency.
2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**:
    - Spans large geographical areas (e.g., the Internet).
    - Connects multiple LANs.
3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:
    - Covers a city or campus.
4. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**:
    - Small network for personal devices (e.g., phone, smartwatch).

### **Introduction to IP Addresses**

- **Definition**: An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to devices in a network to enable identification and communication.
- **Format**:
    - **IPv4**: 32-bit, written as `192.168.1.1`.
    - **IPv6**: 128-bit, written as `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

### **Types of IP Addresses**

1. **Public IP**:
    - Globally unique and used to connect to the Internet.
    - Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS).
2. **Private IP**:
    - Used within private networks (e.g., homes, offices).
    - Ranges:
        - `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`
        - `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
        - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`
3. **Static IP**:
    - Fixed and manually configured.
    - Common for servers or networked printers.
4. **Dynamic IP**:
    - Automatically assigned by a DHCP server.
    - Common for most devices.

### **Subnetting**

- Divides a network into smaller, manageable segments (subnets).
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24` represents a subnet with 256 possible addresses.

### **Key Protocols in Networking**

1. **TCP/IP**:
    - Core protocol suite for Internet communication.
2. **HTTP/HTTPS**:
    - Protocols for web browsing.
3. **DNS**:
    - Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
4. **DHCP**:
    - Assigns dynamic IP addresses.

### **Conclusion**

Networks enable seamless communication and resource sharing, with IP addresses playing a vital role in identifying and connecting devices. Understanding basic networking concepts and IP types is crucial for managing modern systems.
