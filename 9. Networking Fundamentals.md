    - **IPv6**: 128-bit, written as `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

---

### **Types of IP Addresses**

1. **Public IP**:
    - Globally unique and used to connect to the Internet.
    - Example: `8.8.8.8` (Google DNS).
2. **Private IP**:
    - Used within private networks (e.g., homes, offices).
    - Ranges:
        - `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`
        - `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`

    - Common for servers or networked printers.
4. **Dynamic IP**:
    - Automatically assigned by a DHCP server.
    - Common for most devices.

---

### **Subnetting**

- Divides a network into smaller, manageable segments (subnets).
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24` represents a subnet with 256 possible addresses.

---

### **Key Protocols in Networking**

1. **TCP/IP**:
    - Core protocol suite for Internet communication.

4. **DHCP**:
    - Assigns dynamic IP addresses.

---

### **Conclusion**

Networks enable seamless communication and resource sharing, with IP addresses playing a vital role in identifying and connecting devices. Understanding basic networking concepts and IP types is crucial for managing modern systems.

### ** How Data Moves from Your Network to a Server and Back (e.g., google.com)**

---

### **Step 1: DNS Resolution**

1. **Purpose**: Convert a human-readable domain name (e.g., `google.com`) into an IP address (e.g., `142.250.190.78`).
2. **Process**:
    - Your browser queries a **DNS server** to find the IP address for the domain.
    - If not cached locally, the query travels through multiple DNS servers until resolved.

---

### **Step 2: TCP Connection Establishment**

1. **Protocol**: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.
2. **Three-Way Handshake**:
    - Your computer sends a **SYN** packet to the server to initiate a connection.
    - The server responds with **SYN-ACK**.
    - Your computer sends an **ACK**, completing the connection.

---

### **Step 3: Sending the HTTP/HTTPS Request**

1. **Request**: Your browser sends an **HTTP/HTTPS GET request** to the server's IP address, requesting specific content (e.g., `index.html`).
2. **Encryption** (HTTPS):
    - If HTTPS is used, the data is encrypted using SSL/TLS to ensure secure communication.

---

### **Step 4: Data Travels Through the Internet**

1. **Routing**:
    - Data is broken into packets and routed through multiple devices (routers) across the Internet.
    - Routers determine the best path based on protocols like **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**.
2. **Hops**:
    - Packets may traverse many intermediate networks before reaching the destination.

---

### **Step 5: Server Processes the Request**

1. **Web Server**:
    - The server (e.g., Google's web server) receives the request and processes it.
    - It locates the requested content and prepares the response.
2. **Response**:
    - The server sends the response (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) back to your computer.

---

### **Step 6: Data Returns to You**

1. **Reverse Path**:
    - Packets containing the response travel back through the Internet, following a similar route.
    - Routers and protocols ensure the data is delivered correctly.
2. **Reassembly**:
    - Packets are reassembled at your computer into the original data (e.g., a web page).

---

### **Step 7: Rendering the Content**

1. **Browser**:
    - Your browser renders the data into a human-readable format (e.g., displaying `google.com`).
2. **Caching**:
    - Frequently accessed data may be cached locally or by an intermediate CDN (Content Delivery Network) to improve speed.

---

### **Key Components in Data Movement**

- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **Routers**: Direct data packets across networks.
- **Protocols**:
    - **HTTP/HTTPS**: For web communication.
    - **TCP/IP**: For reliable data transfer.
    - **BGP**: Manages routing between networks.
- **Encryption**: Ensures secure communication over HTTPS.

---

### **Summary**

When you access a website like `google.com`, data flows through a process involving DNS resolution, routing, secure communication, server processing, and rendering. Each step involves specific technologies to ensure fast and reliable data transfer.

![[Pasted image 20250129041736.png]]

### **Notes on Network Addresses and Subnet Masks**

---

### **1. Introduction to Network Addresses**

- **Network Address**: A unique identifier for devices in a network, enabling communication and data transfer.
- Used in both local and wide area networks (LANs and WANs).
- Composed of an **IP address** and a **Subnet Mask**.

---

### **2. IP Addresses**

- **Definition**: A numerical label assigned to devices in a network.
    
- **Types**:
    
    1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**:
        - 32-bit address written as four octets (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
        - Example: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001` (binary representation).
    2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**:
        - 128-bit address written in hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
        - Larger address space for modern networks.
- **Types of IPv4 Addresses**:
    
    - **Public IP**: Globally unique; accessible over the Internet.
    - **Private IP**: Used within local networks; ranges include:
        - `10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255`
        - `172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255`
        - `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255`

---

### **3. Subnet Masks**

- **Definition**: A 32-bit number used to divide an IP address into the **network** and **host** portions.
- Written in the same dotted-decimal format as IPv4 (e.g., `255.255.255.0`).
- Example:
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.100`
    - Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
    - Network Portion: `192.168.1`
    - Host Portion: `100`.

Who can and who can't communicate:
![[Pasted image 20250129042127.png]]

Network Split up into two (Half Addresses are assigned to each device): 
![[Pasted image 20250129042348.png]]

---

### **4. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation**

- Shorthand for denoting subnet masks.
- Written as `IP/Prefix Length`:
    - **Example**: `192.168.1.0/24`
    - The `/24` indicates 24 bits are for the network, leaving 8 bits for hosts.

![[Pasted image 20250129042820.png]]

Calculating the CIDR Notation:
The `1s` should be contiguous from left to right, followed by all `0s`. 
- Valid: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000` (Decimal: `255.255.0.0`).
- Invalid: `11111111.00000000.11111111.00000000` (Decimal: `255.0.255.0`).

![[Pasted image 20250129043123.png]]

### **5. Classes of IPv4 Addresses (Traditional)**

|Class|Range|Default Subnet Mask|Usage|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|`1.0.0.0 - 126.0.0.0`|`255.0.0.0` (/8)|Large networks|
|B|`128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0`|`255.255.0.0` (/16)|Medium networks|
|C|`192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0`|`255.255.255.0` (/24)|Small networks|
|D|`224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255`|N/A|Multicast|
|E|`240.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255`|N/A|Experimental|

---

### **6. Subnetting**

- **Purpose**: Divides a larger network into smaller, manageable sub-networks.
- **Benefits**:
    - Reduces network congestion.
    - Improves security and performance.
    - Efficiently utilizes IP addresses.

---

### **7. Subnet Mask and Host Calculation**

- **Formula**:
    - **Number of Subnets**: 2n2^n, where nn is the number of borrowed bits.
    - **Number of Hosts per Subnet**: 2h−22^h - 2, where hh is the number of remaining host bits.
- **Example**:
    - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.128` or `/25`.
    - **Hosts**: 27−2=1262^7 - 2 = 126.

1. Each octet of the subnet mask must align with this rule.
2. Only specific decimal values are valid:
    - Valid octet values: `0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254, 255`.

---

### **8. Examples of Subnet Masks and CIDR**

|Subnet Mask|CIDR|Number of Hosts|
|---|---|---|
|`255.255.255.0`|`/24`|254|
|`255.255.255.128`|`/25`|126|
|`255.255.255.192`|`/26`|62|

---

### **9. Broadcast and Network Addresses**

- **Network Address**: The first address in a subnet (used to identify the subnet).
    - Example: `192.168.1.0/24`.
- **Broadcast Address**: The last address in a subnet (used to send data to all devices in the subnet).
    - Example: `192.168.1.255/24`.

---

### **10. Summary**

- **Network Address**: Identifies a network.
- **Subnet Mask**: Defines the network and host portions of an IP address.
- Subnetting is crucial for efficient IP address utilization, enhanced security, and improved network management.
