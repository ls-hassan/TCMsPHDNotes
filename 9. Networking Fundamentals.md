### ** How Data Moves from Your Network to a Server and Back (e.g., google.com)**

---

### **Step 1: DNS Resolution**

1. **Purpose**: Convert a human-readable domain name (e.g., `google.com`) into an IP address (e.g., `142.250.190.78`).
2. **Process**:
    - Your browser queries a **DNS server** to find the IP address for the domain.
    - If not cached locally, the query travels through multiple DNS servers until resolved.

---

### **Step 2: TCP Connection Establishment**

1. **Protocol**: **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**.
2. **Three-Way Handshake**:
    - Your computer sends a **SYN** packet to the server to initiate a connection.
    - The server responds with **SYN-ACK**.
    - Your computer sends an **ACK**, completing the connection.

---

### **Step 3: Sending the HTTP/HTTPS Request**

1. **Request**: Your browser sends an **HTTP/HTTPS GET request** to the server's IP address, requesting specific content (e.g., `index.html`).
2. **Encryption** (HTTPS):
    - If HTTPS is used, the data is encrypted using SSL/TLS to ensure secure communication.

---

### **Step 4: Data Travels Through the Internet**

1. **Routing**:
    - Data is broken into packets and routed through multiple devices (routers) across the Internet.
    - Routers determine the best path based on protocols like **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**.
2. **Hops**:
    - Packets may traverse many intermediate networks before reaching the destination.

---

### **Step 5: Server Processes the Request**

1. **Web Server**:
    - The server (e.g., Google's web server) receives the request and processes it.
    - It locates the requested content and prepares the response.
2. **Response**:
    - The server sends the response (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) back to your computer.

---

### **Step 6: Data Returns to You**

1. **Reverse Path**:
    - Packets containing the response travel back through the Internet, following a similar route.
    - Routers and protocols ensure the data is delivered correctly.
2. **Reassembly**:
    - Packets are reassembled at your computer into the original data (e.g., a web page).

---

### **Step 7: Rendering the Content**

1. **Browser**:
    - Your browser renders the data into a human-readable format (e.g., displaying `google.com`).
2. **Caching**:
    - Frequently accessed data may be cached locally or by an intermediate CDN (Content Delivery Network) to improve speed.

---

### **Key Components in Data Movement**

- **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **Routers**: Direct data packets across networks.
- **Protocols**:
    - **HTTP/HTTPS**: For web communication.
    - **TCP/IP**: For reliable data transfer.
    - **BGP**: Manages routing between networks.
- **Encryption**: Ensures secure communication over HTTPS.

---

### **Summary**

When you access a website like `google.com`, data flows through a process involving DNS resolution, routing, secure communication, server processing, and rendering. Each step involves specific technologies to ensure fast and reliable data transfer.

Network Split up into two (Half Addresses are assigned to each device): 
![[Pasted image 20250129042348.png]]

---

### **4. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation**

- Shorthand for denoting subnet masks.
- Written as `IP/Prefix Length`:
    - **Example**: `192.168.1.0/24`
    - The `/24` indicates 24 bits are for the network, leaving 8 bits for hosts.

![[Pasted image 20250129042820.png]]

Calculating the CIDR Notation:
The `1s` should be contiguous from left to right, followed by all `0s`. 
- Valid: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000` (Decimal: `255.255.0.0`).
- Invalid: `11111111.00000000.11111111.00000000` (Decimal: `255.0.255.0`).

![[Pasted image 20250129043123.png]]

- **Example**:
    - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.128` or `/25`.
    - **Hosts**: 27−2=1262^7 - 2 = 126.

1. Each octet of the subnet mask must align with this rule.
2. Only specific decimal values are valid:
    - Valid octet values: `0, 128, 192, 224, 240, 248, 252, 254, 255`.

---

### **3. Types of VPNs**

- **Remote Access VPN** – Allows individuals to securely connect to a private network from anywhere.
- **Site-to-Site VPN** – Connects entire networks (e.g., branch offices) over the Internet securely.
- **SSL VPN** – Uses a web browser for secure remote access without needing special software.

---

### **4. Common VPN Protocols**

|**Protocol**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)**|Fast but weak encryption.|
|**L2TP/IPSec (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**|More secure, supports strong encryption.|
|**OpenVPN**|Highly secure, open-source, widely used.|
|**WireGuard**|Modern, fast, and lightweight VPN protocol.|
|**IKEv2/IPSec**|Good for mobile devices, stable and secure.|

✅ **Bypassing Geo-Restrictions** – Access region-locked content.  
✅ **Safe Public Wi-Fi Usage** – Encrypts traffic on unsecured networks.  
✅ **Remote Access** – Employees can securely access corporate networks.

---

### **6. VPN Limitations**

❌ **Slower Speeds** – Encryption may reduce connection speed.  
❌ **Blocked by Some Services** – Some websites detect and block VPNs.  
❌ ***Not a Complete Anonymity Tool*** – VPNs do not make users 100% anonymous.

---

### **7. Summary**

A **VPN** enhances **security, privacy, and remote access** by encrypting data and masking IP addresses. It is widely used for **bypassing restrictions**, **protecting data**, and **connecting securely to private networks**. 🚀
