# **SSH Using OpenSSH â€“ Notes**

## **1. What is OpenSSH?**

**OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell)** is a suite of tools that provides **secure remote access, authentication, and file transfers** over an encrypted connection. It is widely used for managing remote servers and devices.

- Open-source implementation of **SSH protocol**.
- **Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows**.
- Uses **port 22** by default.

---

## **2. Installing OpenSSH**

### **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu-based)**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

### **Linux (RHEL/CentOS-based)**

```bash
sudo yum install openssh-server -y
```

### **Windows (PowerShell - Admin Mode)**

```powershell
Add-WindowsFeature -Name OpenSSH-Server
```

### **Verify SSH Installation**

```bash
ssh -V
```

---

## **3. Starting & Managing SSH Service**

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`sudo systemctl start ssh`|Start the SSH service.|
|`sudo systemctl stop ssh`|Stop the SSH service.|
|`sudo systemctl restart ssh`|Restart SSH service after changes.|
|`sudo systemctl enable ssh`|Enable SSH to start on boot.|
|`sudo systemctl status ssh`|Check SSH service status.|

---

## **4. Connecting to a Remote Server using SSH**

Basic syntax:

```bash
ssh username@remote_host
```

Example:

```bash
ssh john@192.168.1.100
```

To use a specific port (e.g., 2222):

```bash
ssh -p 2222 john@192.168.1.100
```

---

## **5. SSH Authentication Methods**

### **a) Password-based Authentication (Less Secure)**

- Default method, but vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- To **disable password authentication**, edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
    
    ```bash
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ```
    

### **b) Key-based Authentication (Recommended)**

1. **Generate SSH Key Pair (Client Machine)**
    
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```
    
2. **Copy Public Key to Remote Server**
    
    ```bash
    ssh-copy-id user@remote_host
    ```
    
3. **Login Without a Password**
    
    ```bash
    ssh user@remote_host
    ```
    

---

## **6. Transferring Files Using OpenSSH**

### **Secure Copy Protocol (SCP)**

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`scp file.txt user@remote_host:/path/`|Copy a file to a remote system.|
|`scp -r folder/ user@remote_host:/path/`|Copy a folder recursively.|
|`scp user@remote_host:/path/file.txt .`|Download a file from a remote system.|

### **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**

Start an **SFTP session**:

```bash
sftp user@remote_host
```

Common SFTP commands:

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`ls`|List files on the remote system.|
|`get file.txt`|Download file.|
|`put file.txt`|Upload file.|
|`exit`|Exit SFTP session.|

---

## **7. SSH Port Forwarding (Tunneling)**

SSH can securely tunnel network connections.

### **a) Local Port Forwarding**

Forward local port to a remote service:

```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@remote_host
```

(Now, accessing **localhost:8080** on your machine forwards traffic to **remote_host:80**).

### **b) Remote Port Forwarding**

Expose a local service to a remote system:

```bash
ssh -R 9000:localhost:3000 user@remote_host
```

(Now, users on the remote host can access **localhost:9000**, which maps to your local **port 3000**).

---

## **8. Securing OpenSSH**

### **a) Change Default SSH Port**

Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
Port 2222
```

Then restart SSH:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

### **b) Disable Root Login**

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
PermitRootLogin no
```

### **c) Limit SSH Access to Specific Users**

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```bash
AllowUsers alice bob
```

### **d) Enable Firewall for SSH (UFW Example)**

Allow only SSH traffic:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
```

For a custom SSH port (e.g., 2222):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp
```

---

## **9. Troubleshooting OpenSSH Issues**

|**Issue**|**Solution**|
|---|---|
|**Connection Refused**|Ensure SSH service is running (`sudo systemctl start ssh`).|
|**Permission Denied (publickey)**|Verify key is in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.|
|**Slow Login**|Disable DNS lookup in `sshd_config` (`UseDNS no`).|
|**Host Key Verification Failed**|Remove old key: `ssh-keygen -R remote_host`.|

---

## **10. Summary**

- **OpenSSH provides secure remote access, file transfers, and tunneling.**
- **Key-based authentication is recommended** over passwords.
- Supports **SCP & SFTP** for secure file transfers.
- **Port forwarding** allows tunneling of network connections.
- **Securing OpenSSH** with firewall rules, non-root access, and key authentication is essential.

---

To **turn off the SSH service** on your Linux machine, you can use the following commands, depending on the init system your distribution uses (most modern distributions use `systemd`):

### **1. Stop the SSH service (temporary)**

To **stop SSH temporarily** (it will restart after a reboot):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ssh
```

If your system uses `sshd` as the service name (some distributions might):

```bash
sudo systemctl stop sshd
```

This will **stop the SSH service immediately**, and remote users will no longer be able to connect.

### **2. Disable the SSH service (prevent it from starting on boot)**

To **disable SSH from starting automatically** on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable ssh
```

Or if using `sshd` as the service name:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable sshd
```

This will stop the SSH service from running at startup but won't affect the current session. The service will still stop if you reboot your machine.

### **3. Verify SSH service status**

To **check the status** of the SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

If using `sshd`:

```bash
sudo systemctl status sshd
```

This command will tell you whether the SSH service is running or stopped.

---

### **4. Re-enable the SSH service (if needed)**

To **re-enable SSH** to start automatically after a reboot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

Or using `sshd`:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sshd
```

---

### **Important Notes**

- Stopping the SSH service means you can no longer connect remotely to the machine via SSH.
- If you need to **reconnect** via SSH after disabling the service, you'll need to either re-enable it or access the machine physically to start the service again.
